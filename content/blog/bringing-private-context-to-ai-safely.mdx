## Why We Built Kinetiq

The modern AI landscape is fragmented. Startups and enterprises alike struggle to keep track of which models perform best for their specific use cases. Kinetiq was born from a simple observation: **Comparison is hard.**

Most comparison charts are marketing fluff. We wanted to build something that felt like a utility—a precise instrument for measuring value.

### Key Features

*   **Standardized Benchmarks:** We normalize performance metrics across different providers.
*   **Cost Projection:** Estimate your monthly spend based on token usage patterns.
*   **Integration Scoring:** How easily does a model slot into your existing API infrastructure?

We designed the interface to be "quiet." No flashing banners, no aggressive upsells. Just the data you need to make a decision, presented in a clean, readable format.

### What's Next

We are rolling out team-based collaboration features next month. Stay tuned for more updates on how we're making AI procurement simpler and calmer.
