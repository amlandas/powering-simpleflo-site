# Principles

<Callout tone="subtle">
  Simpleflo is built for clarity in a fast-moving ecosystem. These principles keep everything coherent as it evolves.
</Callout>

## Simple defaults

The first experience should be obvious.

Not “simple” as in limited, but simple as in *calm*: the interface should not demand a configuration mindset before it earns one.

Advanced modes are useful. They just shouldn’t be the first thing you see.

<MarginNote>
  “Simple defaults” means the first experience is calm — not that the system is shallow.
</MarginNote>

<ProofCard title="Design rule">
  Complexity should be earned by real needs.

## Security first

Security isn’t a feature you add later. It’s a constraint you design inside from day one.

That means secure-by-default, least privilege, and explicit user control when something risky is about to happen.

<ProofCard title="Security rule">
  Risky actions should be explicit.
</ProofCard>

## Consistency and cohesion

If each tool feels like a different universe, people pay a cognitive tax every time they switch.

Simpleflo aims for one mental model across everything:
- familiar layout rhythms,
- consistent terminology,
- consistent “proof” and traceability patterns.

<ProofCard title="Cohesion rule">
  Don’t make users re-learn you.
</ProofCard>

## Less setup, more work

If people have to become part-time DevOps to use AI tools, we’ve failed.

The job is to remove undifferentiated setup work: wiring, configuration drift, and repetitive connector setup.

<ProofCard title="Outcome rule">
  Setup should fade into the background.
</ProofCard>

## Earned delight

Delight should come from craft, not claims.

From small details that make you trust the tool: visible sources, clear boundaries, predictable behavior, and interfaces that feel calm even when the world isn’t.

<ProofCard title="Delight rule">
  Earn trust through clarity, not hype.
</ProofCard>
