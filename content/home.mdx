# Simpleflo

<Callout tone="subtle">
  <strong>Clarity for AI work.</strong> Written, not shouted.
</Callout>

AI work got loud fast.

Not because the ideas are bad—most of them are brilliant—but because the wiring is everywhere. Every new model, every new connector, every new “stack” adds one more little ceremony: configure this, paste that, re-do the setup in a second place, repeat it again when you switch tools.

And the strange part: the more capable the tools become, the more time we spend preparing to use them.

<MarginNote>
  The goal isn’t fewer tools. It’s fewer “setup rituals” between you and real work.
</MarginNote>

Simpleflo is my attempt at the opposite direction: **calm defaults, cohesive experiences, and security-first decisions**—so the setup fades into the background and you can stay with the real question you’re trying to answer.

## What lives here

Simpleflo is a small suite of tools with one shared personality: reduce noise, keep the interface quiet, make the important thing obvious.

**Kinetiq** helps you choose AI tools without swimming through biased lists and shallow reviews. It’s a structured directory plus comparison and analysis, designed to turn “I’m not sure what to use” into a shortlist you can defend.

**Scientia** is a knowledge explorer: a place to ask questions across your sources and see where the answer comes from. It’s built for traceability—citations and retrieval traces are part of the experience, not an afterthought.

**Conduit** (coming soon) is for the part nobody enjoys: connector installs, tool wiring, and context overload. The idea is simple: managed connectors plus a personal knowledge layer that helps AI tools use *precise* context instead of drowning in it.

<MarginNote>
  “Personal knowledge” here means context that stays usable as it grows — not a pile of files.

  Secure-by-default, and risky actions should be explicit.

## A small promise

Simpleflo isn’t trying to be everything. It’s trying to be the quiet layer that keeps your work coherent as the ecosystem changes.

That means:
- Defaults that feel obvious.
- Interfaces that don’t ask you to think in configuration files.
- And an obsession with “did this help you get to the answer faster?”
