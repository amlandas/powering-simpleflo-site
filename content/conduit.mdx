# Conduit

<Callout tone="subtle">
  Managed connectors and personal knowledge — without setup rabbit holes. <strong>(Coming soon)</strong>
</Callout>

Modern AI tooling has a quiet tax.

Not the subscription cost—the *setup cost*.

You install a connector. Configure a server. Repeat the same wiring for a different tool. Then you add documents, then more documents, and eventually the model gets worse because the context is bloated and messy.

The ecosystem is powerful, but it asks too much of the person using it.

<MarginNote>
  Setup work scales badly: every new tool multiplies the wiring surface area.
</MarginNote>

Conduit is the idea that this should feel boring and safe:

- connector setup should be managed,
- execution should be sandboxed by default,
- and your personal knowledge should be served as **precise context**, not a pile of files.

## The pain Conduit targets

### 1) Connector setup is still manual
Even for experienced users, connector setup is fragile: versions drift, permissions are unclear, and configuration becomes tribal knowledge.

### 2) “Just add documents” doesn’t scale
Dumping lots of documents into a tool creates context overload: the model starts to miss what matters, or it spends tokens on irrelevant text.

### 3) Trust is hard
If you’re installing third-party connectors, you need strong boundaries: least privilege, isolation, and explicit permissions.

## The direction (no hype)

Conduit is not a promise of magic. It’s a design direction:

- **Managed connector installs**: discover, install, and configure MCP servers through a guided experience.
- **Personal knowledge layer**: transform your artifacts into a usable knowledge layer, so tools get the right context without bloat.
- **Secure-by-default boundaries**: isolation, explicit permissions, and clear visibility into what a connector can access.

## Security stance (as a design constraint)

Conduit assumes that tools and connectors can be risky.

So the default should be:
- isolated execution boundaries,
- explicit permission prompts,
- and a bias toward “no” unless the user chooses otherwise.

That’s not paranoia. It’s basic respect for the environment people work in.
