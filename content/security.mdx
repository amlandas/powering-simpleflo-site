# Security

<Callout tone="subtle">
  Security-first, without security theater.
</Callout>

Some sites treat security like a badge.

Simpleflo treats it like a constraint: if we can’t build something safely, we shouldn’t build it at all.

That doesn’t mean paranoia. It means boring, practical decisions:
- least privilege,
- explicit user control,
- and minimal data handling.

<MarginNote>
  Security is easiest when it’s legible: users can tell what’s happening and why.

## Secure defaults

The default posture should be safe for normal use.

If there’s a risky operation, it should feel like one:
- the UI should make it obvious,
- the action should be intentional,
- and the boundary should be clear.

## Minimal data handling

If we don’t need data, we shouldn’t collect it.

And when we do handle sensitive information—like keys, tokens, or private sources—the safest place for that is not the browser. Server-side handling exists for a reason.

## Clear boundaries

Good security is legible.

People should be able to understand:
- what stays local,
- what crosses a network boundary,
- what a connector can access,
- and what the system will never touch.
