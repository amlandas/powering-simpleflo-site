# Kinetiq

<Callout tone="subtle">
  A calmer way to choose AI tools.
</Callout>

Choosing an AI tool should feel like choosing a wrench.

You shouldn’t need a week of research, five tabs of contradictory opinions, and a sixth sense for affiliate incentives. You should be able to say, “Here’s what I need,” see the tradeoffs, and move on with your work.

But the ecosystem isn’t built that way yet. It’s fast, noisy, and sometimes intentionally confusing.

Kinetiq is my attempt at a calmer middle layer: **a structured directory plus comparisons and analysis** designed to help you make a choice you can explain—without drowning in hype.

## The problem: directories that yell

Most directories are either:
- static lists that go stale quickly, or
- “rankings” that hide the incentives behind them.

And most comparisons are either too shallow (“good for creators!”) or too technical (“supports X tokens”) without translating that into a decision.

The result is decision fatigue. People either:
- pick what they’ve heard of (brand gravity), or
- pick what’s trending (recency bias), or
- never pick at all (analysis paralysis).

<MarginNote>
  The best tool depends on your constraints. Kinetiq is designed to make constraints visible.

## What Kinetiq does today

Kinetiq focuses on three practical loops:

### 1) Browse a curated directory
A searchable, filterable database of AI tools—organized by what they’re used for, not just what they call themselves.

### 2) Compare a short list with structure
You can select a small set (up to five) and generate a comparison matrix that’s designed to be strategic: strengths, weaknesses, and where each option fits best.

### 3) Add context with grounding and analysis
Kinetiq is designed to keep the database from becoming a museum: it can discover and refresh tool entries via search grounding, and it can summarize differences in a way that maps to real decisions.

## How it works (high level)

Kinetiq follows a simple pattern:

- The interface stays fast and readable.
- Requests that require model calls go to a server-side layer.
- The server-side layer talks to the model and returns structured output for the UI to render.

This matters for two reasons:
1) It keeps keys out of the browser.
2) It makes the comparison output predictable—something you can present as a table, not a blob of text.

## How it stays grounded

“AI-assisted” is a dangerously vague phrase. Kinetiq tries to make it concrete:

- Comparisons are framed as tradeoffs, not verdicts.
- Output is structured so you can inspect it.
- The directory uses consistent dimensions so different entries can actually be compared.

And importantly: Kinetiq should help you decide—not decide for you.

  Kinetiq can’t remove bias from the internet. It aims to reduce bias compared to ad-driven lists by making structure, tradeoffs, and alternatives visible.

## Where Kinetiq is headed

The direction is simple: keep improving the “time-to-shortlist” experience without adding noise.

More depth is welcome only if it makes the decision clearer.
