<Callout tone="subtle">
  Notes on building calmer AI workflows — plus the tools themselves.
</Callout>

This page is intentionally simple: a set of written entries you can actually read.

No dashboards yelling for attention. No “latest updates” stream. Just three focuses—each trying to remove a different kind of friction that shows up in modern AI work.

## Kinetiq: choosing tools with fewer regrets

If you’ve ever tried to pick an AI tool for a real need—writing, research, coding, design, workflow automation—you’ve seen the same pattern:

1) ten listicles that disagree,  
2) affiliate incentives hiding in plain sight, and  
3) comparisons that talk about vibes instead of tradeoffs.

<MarginNote>
  When comparisons are inconsistent, you’re not deciding — you’re guessing with nicer typography.
</MarginNote>

Kinetiq is built to replace “scrolling until you’re tired” with a calmer decision loop: browse a structured directory, compare a short list consistently, and leave with a choice you can explain.

<ProofCard title="What stays grounded">
  Comparisons are structured, tradeoffs are explicit, and the goal is a defensible shortlist.

## Scientia: knowledge exploration with receipts

When you ask questions over your sources, the failure mode is usually not “the model is dumb.” It’s “retrieval is opaque.”

<MarginNote>
  Traceability turns debugging from superstition into engineering.
</MarginNote>

You don’t know what it looked at, what it ignored, or why it answered confidently anyway. Scientia treats traceability as a first-class feature: citations, retrieval traces, and grounded modes are part of how you steer the system.

And when the question genuinely needs outside context, Scientia can blend in world knowledge—without pretending it came from your documents.

<ProofCard title="What stays grounded">
  Answers should show their sources. If outside context is used, it should be clear.

## Conduit: the wiring you shouldn’t have to do

Modern AI tooling is powerful… and oddly manual.

Connectors are installed one-by-one. MCP servers are configured per environment. Documents get dumped into tools that can’t handle the resulting context overload. The result is a new kind of busywork: “AI DevOps,” but for individuals.

Conduit is the idea that this should be *boring*: managed connector installs, safe-by-default execution boundaries, and a personal knowledge layer that serves the right context—small, precise, relevant—so tools don’t get confused by volume.

<ProofCard title="What stays grounded">
  The goal is less setup and less context bloat—not more knobs.
</ProofCard>
